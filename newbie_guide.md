# 🚀 Newbie Guide: AI-Powered n8n Automation

Welcome to your automated workflow factory! This guide will show you how to use your Antigravity setup to go from a simple idea to a live n8n workflow using the **Gemini-Claude Dual-Agent pattern**.

---

## 🏗 The Tool Stack
Before we start, here is what is happening under the hood:
1.  **Launchpad (`mcpl`)**: The "switchboard" that gives your AI access to your tools.
2.  **`n8n-mcp`**: The "librarian" that knows everything about n8n nodes and how to configure them.
3.  **`n8n-skills`**: The "coach" that teaches Claude the best ways to write n8n JSON.

## 🔄 The 3-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Planning (Gemini 3 Pro)
*Goal: Define the architecture, nodes, and logic without writing code yet.*

**Pro-Tip**: Use Gemini for this because of its massive context window and reasoning capabilities.

**Example Prompt:**
> "I want to create an n8n workflow that monitors my Gmail for invoices, uses AI to extract the total amount, and saves it to a Google Sheet. Perform a 'Planning Phase': List the nodes needed, the data structure, and any logic branches (e.g., what if it’s not an invoice?)."

---

### Step 2: Implementation (Claude)
*Goal: Generate the actual n8n JSON artifact.*

**Pro-Tip**: Claude is exceptionally good at following the strict JSON structures required by n8n.

**Example Prompt:**
> "Based on the plan above, use the **`managing-brand-identity`** and **`n8n-skills`** to build the n8n JSON. 
> 
> 1. Use **`n8n-mcp`** to verify the correct property names for the Gmail and Google Sheets nodes.
> 2. Ensure all connections are validated.
> 3. Output the final workflow as a code block."

---

### Step 3: Verification & Deployment
*Goal: Make sure it works and get it into your n8n instance.*

Your Antigravity agent can use **`n8n-mcp`** tools to check your work.

**Example Prompt:**
> "Now, use the `validate_workflow` tool from the MCP server to check the JSON for errors. If it passes, help me deploy it to my self-hosted n8n instance at [Your URL]."

## 🛠 Useful Commands to Remember

| Task | Command / Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Search Nodes** | Ask the agent: "Search n8n nodes for [service name]." |
| **Check Rules** | Ask the agent: "What are the brand rules for this?" |
| **Fix Errors** | Paste an error and say: "Apply the **n8n-skills** to fix this JSON." |

## 💡 Top Tip for Newbies
If the agent ever seems confused about a node, tell it:
> "Use the **`get_node`** tool with `{mode: 'docs'}` to read the official documentation before you continue."
